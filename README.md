## ABC


### Install dependencies

### Running the app
- Run `npm start`

## Assumptions made by you while working on assignment
-  App has different types of widget listing and user can select one of them and visualize data

## Technologies used
- React + Redux

## Time taken to complete assignment (should not be more then 1.5 hours) 
- around 2 hour

## What are TODO(pending items) in project
- Style can be improve()
- Socket connection(to refresh data)

## How you can improve project in future
- Right now i am making all the api call at once, if there is lot of widgets than we can add load more button and on clicking which we can load more data
- Can have more validations (can use typescript for typecheck)
- improve css and animations
